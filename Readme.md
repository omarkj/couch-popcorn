# Popcorn: Standalone CouchDB pastebin
Popcorn is a simple Pastebin that runs on CouchDB.

The look is borrowed from [Ryshcate](http://bitbucket.org/leafstorm/ryshcate/ "Ryshcate").

## Installation
### Replicate it
You can just replicate it from http://omarkj.couchone.com/popcorn, but you need to change the config.js

### Use your own couchapp installation
    git clone git@github.com:omarkj/couch-popcorn.git
    cd couch-popcorn
    Edit the config.js, and create your own .couchapprc
    couchapp push
